Command: blockpcb

Usage: blockpcb <name>

Description:
The 'blockpcb' command moves a Process Control Block (PCB) to the blocked queue.

This action changes the PCB's state to 'blocked' but does not suspend it. If the PCB is already in the blocked state, the command will have no effect.

The command will fail if no PCB with the specified name is found.
