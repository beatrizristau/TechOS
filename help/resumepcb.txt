Command: resumepcb

Usage: resumepcb <name>

Description:
The 'resumepcb' command removes the suspended status from a Process Control Block (PCB).

This action allows a suspended PCB to be considered for execution again. The command clears the 'suspended' flag, returning the PCB to its previous state queue (ready or blocked).

The command will fail if no PCB with the specified name is found.
