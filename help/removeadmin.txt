Command: removeadmin

Usage: removeadmin <username>

Description:
The 'removeadmin' command revokes a user's administrator privileges, demoting them to a basic user. Only the root administrator is permitted to use this command.

The command will fail if:
- The user executing the command is not the root administrator.
- The specified user does not exist.
- The specified user is the root administrator.
- The specified user does not have administrator privileges.

Upon successful execution, the user's role will be changed to 'basic'.
